# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project aims to analyze the sentiment of tweets using machine learning techniques. The sentiment analysis is conducted to determine whether a tweet expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The analysis is performed using a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms.

## Introduction
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, involves determining the sentiment behind a piece of text. This project focuses on analyzing tweets to understand the public's sentiment about various topics.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is collected from Twitter. It contains a variety of tweets labeled with their respective sentiments (positive, negative, or neutral). The dataset can be obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or other sources providing labeled tweet data.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following libraries and tools:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Tweepy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install these requirements using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vaishnavit08/Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis.git
cd Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis
```

Install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To perform sentiment analysis on tweets, follow these steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Use the Tweepy library to collect tweets from Twitter. You need to create a Twitter Developer account and obtain API keys to access the Twitter API.

2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the collected tweets to remove noise, special characters, and stop words. Tokenize the tweets and perform lemmatization.

3. **Feature Extraction**: Convert the text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.

4. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, or Naive Bayes on the preprocessed data.

5. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict the sentiment of new tweets.

You can run the Jupyter notebook `tweet_sentiment.ipynb` to see the entire process in detail.

## Methodology
The sentiment analysis process involves the following steps:
1. **Data Collection**: Using Tweepy to fetch tweets.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Removing unwanted characters, URLs, and stop words.
3. **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
4. **Feature Extraction**: Using TF-IDF vectorization to convert text to numerical data.
5. **Model Training**: Training models like Logistic Regression and evaluating their performance.
6. **Evaluation**: Assessing model accuracy and other metrics.

## Results
The trained model achieves an accuracy of XX% on the test dataset. The detailed results and visualizations are provided in the notebook.
